		<description>The Greengate Hotel should be awarded five stars for the Cocktail Happy Hour every Friday Night between 6pm and 8pm, the cocktails are half price at $7 each, the selection ranges from a &quot;Midori Splice&quot;, &quot;Mojito&quot;, &quot;Poison Ivy&quot;, &quot;Toblerone&quot;, &quot;Appletini&quot; which should be the next &quot;Sex in the City&quot; cocktail and of course the &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;! The drinks are served in large cocktail glasses and you do not have to wait an hour for them to arrive like at the Shangri-La Hotel&#039;s Blu Bar on Level 36!

The ambience and beautiful log fires, cosy leather lounges and chairs makes it hard to beat on a cold winter night!  They also provide a service called &quot;U drink we drive&quot; to get you home safely.

I would definitely recommend it and keep in mind that Elle McPherson spent her early years at this local drinking hole, I know because I was their too!</description>
