		<description>Went to world bar last night after not being for a few years. Cover charge was $15 and we went in a group of 11.. Was told on the phone there was no cover charge. Drinks were pretty expensive. Live band was playing, but pretty average. The lounge areas were filthy to a point were I sat on gum twice. Teapots were average and nothing like they used to be. Will definately give this place a miss and not recommend either. Sorry</description>
